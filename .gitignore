# The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
# 1. Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
# 2. Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
# 3. You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
# 4. You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
# 5. You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
