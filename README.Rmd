**SigRepo_Server** is a reproducible framework that enables users to deploy a **SigRepo** database server either locally or or on any Linux-based cloud platform, and interact with it through a set of API endpoints and a user-friendly web interface built with R Shiny.

The **SigRepo_Server**'s architecture composes of three core components: a **MySQL Database Server**, a set of **Plumber APIs** endpoints, and a **Shiny Dashboard**. 

- The **MySQL Database Server** handles the initialization and management of the **SigRepo** database, which stores biological signatures, collections, and their associated metadata.  
- The **Plumber APIs** provide endpoints to define the database schema, load essential reference tables (such as organisms, platforms, and sample types, etc.), and lastly, store or retrieve *difexp* objects associated with specific signatures. 
- Finally, the **Shiny Dashboard** offers a user-friendly web interface that connects to both the database and APIs. Through this dashboard, users can import, update, or delete their own signatures or collections in the database using a set of functions from our R client package - [**SigRepo**](https://github.com/montilab/SigRepo)

## MySQL Database Server

Our team has deployed a **"SigRepo" MySQL Database Server** on [**Digital Ocean**](https://www.digitalocean.com/), a cloud-based infrastructure platform used for hosting and managing applications. 

- To access the signatures and collections stored in our database, <a target="_blank" href="https://sigrepo.org/">VISIT OUR WEBSITE</a> to create an account or <a href="mailto:sigrepo@bu.edu">CONTACT US</a> to be added.

- [To install a "SigRepo" database instance on your local machine](https://montilab.github.io/SigRepo_Server/articles/install_sigrepo.html){target=_blank}

## Shiny Dashboard

We've developed an R Shiny Dashboard that would allow users to explore and interact with our **SigRepo** database directly without the need to install or maintain the package.
