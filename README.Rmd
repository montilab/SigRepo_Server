# SigRepo_Server

**SigRepo_Server** is a reproducible workflow that enables users to launch a `SigRepo` database server and interact with it via a user-friendly, web-based interface built with R Shiny. The server architecture composes of three core components: a **MySQL database**, **RESTful APIs**, and a **Shiny application**. The **MySQL database** is responsible for initializing and managing the **SigRepo** database, which stores biological signatures and collections along with their associated metadata. The **RESTful APIs** provide endpoints to configure the database schema, import essential reference tables (such as organisms, platforms, and sample types, etc.), and lastly, store or retrieve difexp objects linked to specific signatures. Finally, the **Shiny application** offers an interactive interface that integrates with the MySQL database and APIs, allowing users to perform operations through a set of functions provided by our R client package, [**SigRepo**](https://github.com/montilab/SigRepo).

# Web Interface
An interactive R Shiny dashboard has been developed to make it easy for users to explore and interact with our **SigRepo** database. To access the signatures and collections stored in our database, <a href="https://sigrepo.org/">VISIT OUR WEBSITE</a> to create an account or <a href="mailto:sigrepo@bu.edu">CONTACT US</a> to be added.
