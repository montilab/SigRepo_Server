## SigRepo Components
- Back-end: MariaDB  
- R functions to interact with DB: **This package `SigRepoR`**. See *Installation* below. 
- R6 objects: `OmicSignature` and `OmicSignatureCollection` designed to store signatures. See *Installation* below. Click [here for the vignette](https://montilab.github.io/OmicSignature/articles/OmicSig_vignette.html)  
- User-control API  
- Front-end: R-Shiny interface  

*See our developing [Shiny app server](http://sigrepo.bu.edu:3838/app) ! (BU VPN required)*

## *Installation*
`devtools::install_github(repo = "montilab/OmicSignature")`  

`devtools::install_github(repo = "montilab/SigRepoR", auth_token = "...")`

## About

SigRepoR is an R console package designed to interact
with a MySQL database(With the SigRepo Schema design),
your RShiny application instance(optional), and a remote file
system storing instances of OmicSignature, an R6 object designed to store multi-omics data(Note: you can have all these services on the same server, if you want.).

This package can perform CRUD operations, and, currently, basic analysis commands, such as signature comparisons, and enrichment analysis using hypeR. wielding this package does not require prior SQL knowledge, but would be helpful if you're trying to do more advanced queries.


## Configuration

Before proceeding with uploading signatures, it's important that you 
first configure your session to point to which database to upload to,
along with where to write files to in your file system.

```r
configureSigRepo(
	signatureDirectory="/opt/shiny-server/challenge_project/miscellanea/signatures/",
	databaseServer="sigrepo.bu.edu",
	databasePort="4253",
	applicationPort="",
	signatureServer="sigrepo.bu.edu"
)
```

Now, for downstream queries, you'll be able to establish connections in the 
future without needing to specify which server to query repeatedly.

Assuming you already have your OmicSignature object created, let's work with
uploading.


## Manual of uploading signatures into Database
#### Configuration

Before proceeding with uploading signatures, it's important that you 
first configure your session to point to which database to upload to,
along with where to write files to in your file system.



## Uploading OmicSignature Object

To upload your object completely to your back-end

```r
addSignatureWrapper(
	yourObjectOrFileOfObject,
	thisHandle=yourConnectionHandle,
	uploadPath=sys.getenv("signatureDirectory"),
	user="your SigRepo Username",
	verbose=T
)
```

executing the above:

* writes your object file to disk
* inserts signature metadata into signatures table in the database(addSignature)
* inserts level2 data from that object into the features_signatures table
in the database(addLevel2).
* inserts signature-keyword pairs into the keyword_signatures table in the database(addSignatureKeywords).


## Uploading OmicSignatureCollection Objects

OmicSignatureCollection Objects are simply a group of Omic Signature objects.
You can upload such objects like this:

```r
addSignatureCollection(
	OmicSignatureCollectionObj, 
	connHandle,
  uploadPath=sys.getenv("signatureDirectory"), 
  thisUser="your SigRepo User Name"
)
```

This function:

* "unpacks" the OmicSignatureCollection by getting the "OmicSigList" property
* runs an lapply of the function "addSignatureWrapper" on this list
* inserts signature-to-collection pairs into the signature-to-collection table
in the database(addCollectionSignatures)

If the collection you're uploading doesn't exist as an entry in the collections
table of the database, the addCollectionSignatures function will add that collection as a new entry to the collections table before uploading the pairs.
